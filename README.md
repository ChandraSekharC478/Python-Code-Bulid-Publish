# Python for DevOps

This repository contains Python scripts and examples specifically curated for DevOps automation, infrastructure management, and CI/CD workflows.

## Overview
Python is widely used in DevOps for automating tasks, managing cloud infrastructure, handling configurations, and integrating with DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Topics Covered
This repository covers various aspects of Python for DevOps, focusing on practical implementation and real-world use cases:

### 1. DevOps Automation
- Automating DevOps tasks such as file handling, process automation, and logging.
- Scripting for server management and cloud automation.
- Examples demonstrating API calls and integration with cloud services.

### 2. Infrastructure as Code
- Using Python with tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation.
- Automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.
- Writing scripts to manage infrastructure components efficiently.

### 3. CI/CD Pipelines
- Writing Python scripts to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
- Integrating Python scripts with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other CI/CD tools.
- Automating software release cycles and monitoring deployments.

### 4. Containerization & Orchestration
- Working with Docker (building images, running containers, managing networks) using Python.
- Automating Kubernetes workflows with Python SDKs and APIs.
- Managing containerized applications effectively in production environments.

### 5. Security & Monitoring
- Automating security best practices and compliance checks.
- Implementing logging and monitoring using Python.
- Integrating Python scripts with monitoring tools like Prometheus and ELK stack.

## Running Scripts
To execute any of the Python scripts, use:
```sh
python filename.py
```
Example:
```sh
python automation_script.py
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! Feel free to add new automation scripts, improve existing ones, or share real-world DevOps use cases.
