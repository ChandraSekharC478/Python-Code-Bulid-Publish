# Python for DevOps

This repository contains Python scripts and examples specifically curated for DevOps automation, infrastructure management, and CI/CD workflows.

## Overview
Python is widely used in DevOps for automating tasks, managing cloud infrastructure, handling configurations, and integrating with DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Contents

### 1. Python Basics
- [`variables.py`](https://github.com/ChandraSekharC478/PythonforDevops/blob/main/variables/variables.py): Covers fundamental concepts of Python variables.
- [`premitivedatatypes.py`](https://github.com/ChandraSekharC478/PythonforDevops/blob/main/variables/premitivedatatypes.py): Demonstrates Python's primitive data types.
- [`nonpremitivedatatypes.py`](https://github.com/ChandraSekharC478/PythonforDevops/blob/main/variables/nonpremitivedatatypes.py): Explains non-primitive data types.

### 2. DevOps Automation
- Scripts for automating DevOps tasks like file handling, process automation, and logging.
- Examples demonstrating API calls and integration with cloud services.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code
- Examples using Python with tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation.
- Automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.

### 4. CI/CD Pipelines
- Writing Python scripts to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
- Integration with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other CI/CD tools.

### 5. Containerization & Orchestration
- Using Python to work with Docker (building images, running containers, managing networks).
- Kubernetes automation using Python SDKs.

## Running Scripts
To execute any of the Python scripts, use:
```sh
python filename.py
```
Example:
```sh
python automation_script.py
```
